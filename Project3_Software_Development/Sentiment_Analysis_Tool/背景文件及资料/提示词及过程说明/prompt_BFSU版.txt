Create a Python program with a GUI (using Tkinter) that provides the following features:

#Text File Upload: 
##Let the user select and upload one or more plain text files using a file dialog.

#Sentence Tokenization: 
##For each uploaded text, split the content into individual sentences.

#Sentence-Level Sentiment Analysis: 
##For each sentence in each text: Use a sentiment analysis tool (such as NLTKâ€™s VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer) to calculate a sentiment score ranging from -1 to 1.

#Visualization:
##Display a line graph (using matplotlib) where the X-axis represents sentence order and the Y-axis represents sentiment score. If multiple texts are uploaded, plot each text as a separate line on the same axes for easy comparison.

#GUI Requirements: 
##Have buttons for uploading files and for starting the analysis/visualization process.
##Display the chosen file names visibly in the interface.
##Embed the matplotlib plot directly within the Tkinter application window.

#Executable-Friendly Design: 
##Write the script so it can be easily turned into a standalone executable (for example, using PyInstaller).

#Setup Instructions: 
##Include (as code comments) any necessary package installation steps and provide instructions for running or building as an executable.

Please produce well-organized, commented code that is as user-friendly as possible.
