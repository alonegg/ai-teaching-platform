AB The research based on corpus has had in the last decade an ample
   development in the Brazilian context. Its relevancy is noticed in the
   Linguistics, Applied Linguistics and Computational Linguistics research
   areas. The approach of Corpus Linguistics comes out to systematize
   procedures and to give account of this new way to make research. The
   development of Brazilian Portuguese natural language processing tools
   can help Corpus Linguistics to reach a great development in Brazil.
   However, the advances in Corpus Linguistics in the international scenery
   have not happened yet in many of the research carried out in Brazil. The
   reasons for this is that the procedures and concepts world-wide accepted
   are not still settled here, in spite of having researchers developing
   extraordinary projects based on corpus in Brazil. Thus, this article has
   the intention to discuss several definitions of corpus, the requirements
   and procedures for its elaboration, the available corpora and tools and,
   finally, to present four projects involving corpus whose description and
   detailing can assist other researchers in the corpus building and
   processing.

AB Corpus linguistics is one of the fastest growing areas of linguistics
   because of its interface with neighboring academic disciplines and the
   data-processing capability of a large amount of empirical linguistic
   data. This study reviews research trends from the last two decades
   within the corpus linguistics fields. Specifically, the study applied
   systematic citation analysis procedures to summarize and identify the
   salient research themes and publications from citation-reference data of
   peer-reviewed research articles published and indexed in the Web of
   Science (WoS) between 1997 and 2016. The co-citation analysis of 5,600
   research articles and their 172,352 references indicated that, over the
   four time spans of five years, the corpus linguistics research articles
   have cited works ranging from general linguistics journal titles to
   specialized journal titles and individual books. In terms of the
   research themes of corpus linguistics, the topics of the linguistics
   research have rapidly changed over the time span. More recently, the
   development of web-based large monitor corpora and corpus analysis
   software has contributed significantly to the dynamic and productive
   interaction of research in the discipline. This may indicate the
   evolving and juvenile nature of corpus linguistics and its possibility
   of growing into a multi-disciplinary field. Although there are
   exceptions to all of the research patterns found in the co-citation
   analysis, the current study also discusses the most up-to-date research
   trends and the future directions of corpus linguistics.

   linguistic research but have also had an impact on second language
   learning and teaching. In the field of applied linguistics, more and
   more researchers and practitioners treasure what corpus linguistics has
   to offer to language pedagogy. Still, corpora and corpus tools have yet
   to be widely implemented in pedagogical contexts. The aim of this
   article is to provide an overview of pedagogical corpus applications and
   to review recent publications in the area of corpus linguistics and
   language teaching. It covers indirect corpus applications, such as in
   syllabus or materials design, as well as direct applications of corpora
   in the second language classroom. The article aims to illustrate how
   both general and specialized language corpora can be used in these
   applications and discusses directions for future research in applied
   corpus linguistics.

AB This paper examines the relationship between corpus linguistics and
   theoretical linguistics from a variety of standpoints. We consider the
   nature of the fit between particular theoretical approaches and the
   three areas in which corpus linguistics has made a significant
   contribution to our understanding of language: the provision of
   frequency information, the highlighting of the importance of
   collocations, and the description of variation and text types. The
   complex relationship between data, theory, and representation is
   described with the aim of situating corpus-based research with respect
   to different linguistic theories, looking broadly at British and
   American traditions and paying particular attention to usage-based
   models of language. We then briefly discuss some current issues
   surrounding theoretical developments within corpus linguistics,
   including the divide between cognitive and social perspectives; the
   representation of corpus-based generalisations; and the relationship
   between patterns in corpus data and patterns in the mind.

AB Corpora are often referred to as the ‘tools’ of corpus linguistics.
   However, it is important to recognize that corpora are simply linguistic
   data and that specialized software tools are required to view and
   analyze them. The functionality offered by software tools largely
   dictates what corpus linguistics research methods are available to a
   researcher, and hence, the design of tools will become an increasingly
   important factor as corpora become larger and the statistical analysis
   of linguistic data becomes increasingly complex. In this paper, I will
   first discuss how separating the data from the tools resolves various
   issues that are hotly debated within the field. Next, I will offer a
   critical look at the development of four generations of corpus tools,
   discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Then, I will discuss the role
   of programming in corpus linguistics tools creation and present a model
   for the development of future corpus tools. Finally, I will show a
   real-world example of a next-generation corpus tool that was developed
   for use in language learning.

   computation of association measures as well as the impact that
   neglecting the sampling structure of a corpus can have on a statistical

AB The use of corpora that are divided into temporally ordered stages is
   becoming increasingly wide-spread in historical corpus linguistics. This
   development is partly due to the fact that more and more resources of
   this kind are being developed. Since the assessment of frequency changes
   over multiple periods of time is a relatively recent practice, there are
   few agreed-upon standards of how such trends should be statistically
   interpreted. This article addresses the need for a basic analytical
   toolbox that is specifically tailored to the interpretation of frequency
   changes in multistage diachronic corpora. We present a number of
   suggestions for the analysis of data that analysts commonly face in
   historical studies, but also in the study of language acquisition.

AB Over the past decade, the idea of using corpus linguistics in legal
   interpretation has attracted interest on the part of judges, lawyers,
   and legal academics in the United States. This review provides an
   introduction to this nascent movement, which is generally referred to as
   Law and Corpus Linguistics (LCL). After briefly summarizing LCL's origin
   and development, I situate LCL within legal interpretation by discussing
   the legal concept of ordinary meaning, which establishes the framework
   within which LCL operates. Next, I situate LCL within linguistics by
   identifying the subfields that are most relevant to LCL. I then offer a
   linguistic justification for an idea that is implicit in the case law
   and that provides important support for using corpus analysis in legal
   interpretation: that data about patterns of usage provide evidence of
   how words and other expressions are ordinarily understood. I go on to
   discuss linguistic issues that arise from the use of corpus linguistics
   in disputes that involve lexical ambiguity and categorization. Finally,
   I point out some challenges that the growth of LCL will present for both
   legal professionals and linguists.

AB In the field of neurobiology of language, neuroimaging studies are
   generally based on stimulation paradigms consisting of at least two
   different conditions. Designing those paradigms can be very
   time-consuming and this traditional approach is necessarily
   data-limited. In contrast, in computational and corpus linguistics,
   analyses are often based on large text corpora, which allow a vast
   variety of hypotheses to be tested by repeatedly re-evaluating the data
   set. Furthermore, text corpora also allow exploratory data analysis in
   order to generate new hypotheses. By drawing on the advantages of both
   fields, neuroimaging and computational corpus linguistics, we here
   present a unified approach combining continuous natural speech and MEG
   to generate a corpus of speech-evoked neuronal activity.

   differences between two modern Chinese translations of Don Quijote in
   terms of the use of language archaism. For this purpose, a number of
   statistical techniques applicable in corpus linguistics have been used,
   which exemplifies the foregrounding of quantitative primary data. The
   article provides an original interdisciplinary study which attempts to
   integrate research methods adapted from different areas of research,
   e.g. textual statistics, corpus linguistics, literary stylistics and
   translation studies, into the development of an emerging field known as
   corpus stylistics.

AB The paper surveys overlap between corpus linguistics and variationist
   sociolinguistics. Corpus linguistics is customarily defined as a
   methodology that bases claims about language on usage patterns in
   collections of naturalistic, authentic speech or text. Because this is
   what is typically done in variationist sociolinguistics work, I argue
   that variationist sociolinguists are by definition corpus linguists,
   though of course the reverse is not true: the variationist method
   entails more than merely analyzing usage data, and not all corpus
   analysts are interested in variation. But that being said, a
   considerable and arguably increasing number of corpus linguists not
   formally trained in variationist sociolinguistics are explicitly
   concerned with variation and engage in what I call corpus-based
   variationist linguistics (CVL). I first discuss what unites or divides
   work in CVL and in variationist sociolinguistics. In a plea to cross
   subdisciplinary boundaries, I subsequently identify three research areas
   where variationist sociolinguists may draw inspiration from work in CVL:
   conducting multi-variable research, paying more attention to
   probabilistic grammars, and taking more seriously the
   register-sensitivity of variation patterns.

AB This paper considers the relationship between research using systemic
   functional linguistics and research of the kind referred to as corpus
   linguistics, specifically in a study of ideology in a popular science
   text. The paper argues that ideas in SFL and corpus linguistics may be
   regarded as parallel (register), divergent (grammar and phraseology),
   and complementary (lexis and taxonomy). Following a review of research
   in these areas, the paper presents a case study of evaluation of status
   in a popular science book (The Rough Guide to Evolution). "Status" draws
   on the grammatical concept of projection and on a set of lexis and
   phraseologies. The interaction between grammatical choice and lexical
   choice is quantified. It is argued that particular combinations of lexis
   and grammar are preferred when knowledge is presented as in the process
   of formation, and other combinations are preferred when knowledge is
   presented as in a state of completion. The case study reveals that
   concepts drawn from a systemic functional view of grammar and from a
   corpus linguistic view of phraseology are usefully combined in studying
   ideology.

   Perspectives: Studies in Translatology entitled Corpus linguistics and
   Audiovisual Translation: in search of an integrated approach'. The
   purpose of the volume is to illustrate and discuss the use and limits
   (if any) of corpus-based investigation into audiovisual dialogue and
   audiovisual translation. This special issue also seeks to investigate
   the development of corpus-based approaches to AVT that are able to take
   into account the multiple dimensions of audiovisual translation, the
   technical and professional constraints that are specific to the medium,
   as well as the social factors affecting the translational act (e.g.
   target language and culture norms, self-censorship, patronage, etc.).
   This is achieved through seven contributions, intended to offer a wide
   range of perspectives on the application of corpus linguistics
   methodologies to different AVT modalities. As the contributions in this
   volume suggest, an integrated approach is needed to account for the
   complex semiotic fabric of audiovisual texts, their hybrid nature and
   multiple codes.

AB Corpora have revolutionized nearly all areas of linguistic research over
   the past four decades (McEnery, Xiao and Tono 2006; McEnery and Hardie
   2012). Translation studies and contrastive linguistics are no
   exceptions. Indeed, the rapid development of bilingual parallel corpora
   as well as monolingual and multilingual comparable corpora since the
   early 1990s has been of particular relevance and crucial importance to
   translation studies and contrastive linguistics. This special issue of
   Corpus Linguistics and Linguistic Theory focuses on corpus-based
   translation and contrastive linguistic studies involving two genetically
   different languages, namely English and Chinese, which we believe have
   formed an important interface with its unique features as a result of
   the mutual interaction between the two languages. This introduction will
   first contextualize the special issue by exploring the state of the art
   in using corpora in translation and contrastive linguistic studies,
   particularly in the context of the two languages covered, and then
   provide a synopsis of each article included in this volume and comment
   on its significance and implications for linguistic theorization.

AB The advent of usage-/exemplar-based approaches has resulted in a major
   change in the theoretical landscape of linguistics, but also in the
   range of methodologies that are brought to bear on the study of language
   acquisition/learning, structure, and use. In particular, methods from
   corpus linguistics are now frequently used to study distributional
   characteristics of linguistics units and what they reveal about
   cognitive and psycholinguistic processes. This paper surveys a range of
   psycholinguistic notions that are becoming ever more important in
   theoretical and cognitive linguisticsfor example, frequency,
   entrenchment, dispersion, contingency, surprisal, Zipfian
   distributionsand current corpus-linguistic approaches toward exploring
   these notions and their roles for linguistic cognition.

AB In recent years, continuing advances in technology have increased the
   capacity to automate the extraction of a range of linguistic features of
   texts and thus have provided the impetus for the substantial growth of
   corpus linguistics. While corpus linguistic tools and methods have been
   used extensively in second language learning research, they have also
   been used increasingly in the design and validation of language
   assessments (Callies & Gotz, 2015; Deshors, Gotz, & Laporte, 2016; Park,
   2014). The collection of papers in this special issue represents an
   intentional and systematic effort to encourage the cross-pollination of
   corpus linguistics and language assessment. The research foci of these
   papers take this cross-disciplinary area in exciting, new directions. At
   the same time, the papers also point to some important gaps and provide
   inspiration for additional research. In this commentary, I offer some
   perspectives on how the papers contribute to this cross-disciplinary
   research area and then share my reflections on some of the gaps that
   need to be narrowed or closed if language testing researchers and
   practitioners are to take full advantage of the potential of corpus
   linguistics for language assessment.

AB Usage-based approaches explore how we learn language from our experience
   of language. Related research thus involves the analysis of the usage
   from which learners learn and of learner usage as it develops. This
   program involves considerable data recording, transcription, and
   analysis, using a variety of corpus and computational techniques, many
   of them specially devised for learner language. This article surveys
   relevant developments across the psychology of learning, first and
   second language acquisition, psycholinguistics, corpus linguistics, and
   computational linguistics and identifies challenges and future
   priorities relating to the following issues: (1) analyzing the
   distributional characteristics of linguistic constructions and their
   meanings in large collections of language that are representative of the
   language that learners experience, (2) the longitudinal analysis of
   learner language, and (3) Natural Language Processing analyses of the
   dimensions of language complexity.

   subfields which, despite sharing considerable common ground, tended to
   remain as separate areas of linguistic analysis until quite recently.
   Making use of diachronic and contemporary corpora of English, such as
   the Helsinki Corpus, ARCHER, and COCA, the article illustrates how
   standard corpus practices can indeed contribute to our understanding of
   grammaticalization and related processes of language change. The
   selected case studies deal with the origin of existential there, the
   development of like-parentheticals in contemporary American English, and
   the history of the marker of expository apposition namely.

AB The paper aims at studying the relationship between contrastive
   linguistics (CL) and translation as branches of applied linguistics, on
   one hand, and the use of computer corpora (C.C) on the other. It also
   stresses the fact that the boundaries of CL have been redrawn to
   incorporate the output of C.C in performing various tasks in
   translation, that goes beyond the traditional methods of CL carried out
   exclusively on solving problems in foreign language teaching (FLT). The
   paper supports the call for the manipulation of data obtained from CC in
   contrastive linguistic projects for the betterment of translation
   quality. Previously, CL was concerned with linguistic systems rather
   than language use, but with the introduction of corpora, language use
   become more easily accessible and the field of CL has expanded. The
   access to huge amounts of original texts and their translation in
   electronic format is of great benefit to professional translators, since
   a wide range of translation solutions for any particular source language
   are available by a gentle hit on the required tagging key. As for
   translation-oriented corpus based CL it becomes obvious that the actual
   contrastive study will be carried out in order to obtain data for
   explaining the various phenomena in translation.
   Hence, translation as a communicative event can assume a fully-fledged
   descriptive discipline if it manages to develop its own descriptive
   tools of study. Computer corpora can play a decisive role in turning
   translation into a well-established academic discipline.

   from an empirical perspective, a rather controversial issue due to the
   increasingly use of Corpus Linguistics as a theoretical tool. It makes a
   brief philosophical account on this theoretical framework; then, it
   presents its development within Linguistics and, more precisely, within
   Natural Language Processing. It also discusses the feasibility and
   reliability of the conventionalist framework on linguistic phenomenon.
   Finally, it reasons that this perspective is the most eloquent one for
   coping with an agenda of language studies focused on applications (such
   as Translation and Portuguese as a Second Language) and lexicography.

   Linguistics (CL) research in arts and humanities over the last 20 years,
   tracking changes in popular CL research topics, outlets, highly cited
   authors, and geographical origins based on the metadata of 5,829
   CL-related articles from 429 Scopus-indexed journals. Results reveal an
   increase in corpus-assisted discourse studies, lexical bundles and
   academic writing, alongside newer topics including multilingualism and
   social media. CL studies span 193 languages/dialects with a significant
   rise in Chinese, Russian, Spanish, and Italian CL research over the past
   decade. Clusters of highly cited CL researchers are identified spanning
   (inter)disciplinary research areas. An increase of CL researchers in
   China, Poland, South Korea, Japan, and more is evidence of the now
   global reach of CL research. These findings mirror diachronic
   socio-cultural developments in applied linguistics and society more
   generally and provide insights into what CL research might come next.

   controlled natural languages (CNLs) whose role is to limit the problems
   encountered with natural language, in professional contexts in
   particular. An ergonomic linguistics approach involves first taking into
   account real linguistic productions and analyzing them with corpus
   linguistics methods, and then evaluating the efficacy of linguists'
   recommendations using cognitive evaluation or acceptance tests. Two
   projects concerning human-oriented CNLs that adopt an ergonomic
   linguistics approach are presented, the first in the space domain and

AB Parodi (2007) made the case that corpus linguistics ought to more
   consider the second most common language spoken in the world (Spanish),
   and better disseminate the research findings on the structure of that
   language in the lingua franca of the academic world (English). Moreover,
   Parodi argued that corpus linguists should use corpora that are
   heterogeneous in nature, and that corpus linguistics and discourse
   psycholinguistics should go hand in hand. In the current paper these
   claims are taken to heart with an overview of how corpus linguistics and
   discourse psycholinguistics could be linked, by mapping out their
   relations with the Symbol Interdependency Hypothesis that predicts that
   language encodes the perceptual information. Built on previous research
   that shows that word order reveals semantic information that language
   users can take advantage of, and by showing that the longitude and
   latitude of cities can be estimated based on the way the city names
   share the same linguistic context, this paper shows - using examples
   from the Spanish language and the South American continent - that
   language creates meaning.

AB Corpus linguistics has developed significantly as a branch of applied
   linguistics in recent times, in relation to the possibilities of
   employment in research both in linguistics and in related disciplines.
   This field of study, furthermore, aims at assaying and describing the
   salient characteristics of a language by questioning collected and
   stored data on computer support, in the most applicable way. Considering
   the proposed definition, it was decided to use the methodology of
   collection, archiving, and interrogation, specific of corpus-based
   analysis, within the language educational practices for teaching Italian
   as L1 and L2. For the purposes of experimentation, a working group of 30
   Italian teachers was set up that was aimed at students from different
   educational orders, and specific training was proposed, within a course
   organised by Centro Interculturale della Citta di Torino. At the end of
   the course, the teaching staff were able to use the operative modalities
   of the corpus linguistics with regard to the collection and analysis of
   the linguistic productions of the students, questioning the corpora with
   respect to the linguistic uses. In conclusion, the corpora were used as
   a tool for linguistic analysis and to suggest interventions on error
   analysis, proving effective both for teachers and for learners.
   Actually, all the linguistic productions have been used as a basis for
   the linguistic research proposed to the learners. Teachers were offered
   a questionnaire about experimentation and the results were positive, as
   these showed how corpus linguistics can contribute to a significant
   awareness of learners about the language and learning goals.

AB Corpus Linguistics constitutes a branch of linguistics that affects
   positively the teaching practice of the language teacher. Many corpora,
   where samples of foreign language students are registered, have been
   published to carry out pedagogical interventions to improve the learning
   and teaching process. However, most of these studies are focused on
   students rather than teachers, who require, on this behalf, information
   about their peer's beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes. The present
   study analyzes the possibilities of elaborating a corpus of Spanish
   teachers. A questionnaire for teachers with different profiles and
   settings has been designed and administrated (n=130) to find the role of
   corpus in their teaching practice, the perception of their profession,
   as well as the benefits that the existence of this corpus (CopELE)
   would/could have. Results show unanimity among the participants in
   relation to the benefits this could have, among others, for the
   acknowledgement of their teaching practice.

AB With the increasing recognition of the pedagogical applications of
   corpus linguistics, there has been a growing interest in developing
   teachers' corpus literacy to popularize the use of corpora in language
   education. This longitudinal study investigated Arab Gulf EFL student
   teachers' immediate and long-term responses to corpus literacy
   instruction. After teaching a corpus literacy component to two classes
   of student teachers in a graduate computer-assisted language learning
   course they attended, the author collected focus group data about their
   views on this instruction and their own expected future uses of corpora
   in language learning, teaching and research. Two years later, a group of
   these student teachers (n = 19) responded to a follow-up questionnaire
   exploring their beliefs about corpus literacy integration and their
   multiple uses of corpora. The student teachers reported very positive
   immediate and long-term perceptions of corpus literacy instruction, but
   it was found that such instruction has not brought about all the desired
   changes in their long-term uses of online corpora as a linguistic and
   pedagogical resource, or their attitudes towards doing corpus-based
   TESOL research. However, it is expected that the popularization benefits
   gained from corpus literacy integration could lead to better future
   developments in using corpora for language education and research
   purposes in the target context.

AB To date, there have been very few studies employing corpus techniques in
   the analysis of intercultural interactions. This study analyses the
   indexing of cultural identities in international, interorganisational
   meetings. The approach used draws on methods and insights from corpus
   linguistics and discourse analysis, professional communication,
   intercultural studies and identity studies. It explores how a
   statistically significant single item, we, in specialised corpora of
   authentic professional meetings, signals different identities at
   different moments in the unfolding discourse. Specifically, two research
   questions are answered: 1. What cultural identities are explicitly
   indexed in business meetings through we?
   2. What can corpus linguistics contribute to IC studies?
   While the first question comprises the bulk of the paper, the second
   question is discussed in the final section, along with limitations of
   the approach applied here.

AB Corpus linguistics deserves serious attention from linguists and applied
   linguists, since it is of direct relevance to linguistic description,
   language variation, lexicography, and language education. Linguists tend
   to be indifferent to corpora, however, as the predominant paradigm in
   linguistics is based on introspective data, i.e. native speaker
   intuition. Research has shown that intuitions are not 100 per cent
   reliable; the notion of 'core' grammar needs to be modified to
   accommodate the systematic differences across registers at all
   linguistic levels. Moreover, what linguists perceive as significant
   principles of linguistic organization may not coincide with their
   distribution in patterns of use. One goal of applied linguistics is to
   see what correspondences can be established between the two sets, i.e.
   the set of underlying principles of linguistic organization and the
   patterns of use of these principles revealed by analyses of corpora.
   Regrettably, applied linguists have not embraced corpus linguistics any
   more enthusiastically than formal linguists. Corpus linguistic analyses
   have their problems, too. This paper examines a set of data from the
   lexicon and grammar of world Englishes to suggest that a complete
   reliance on patterns of use may not solve all the problems of language
   description, study of variation, language instruction, translation, and
   lexicography. Furthermore, whereas analyses of corpora are effective in
   revealing dialect variation, they are not of great use in accounting for
   diatypic variation, i.e. the permanent characteristics of users of
   language and recurrent features of their language use, which are crucial
   for understanding human linguistic behavior.

   extracts word-types from diachronic corpora that have undergone the most
   pronounced change in frequency of occurrence in a given period of time.
   Combined with statistical methods from time series analysis, the method
   is able to find meaningful patterns and relationships in diachronic
   corpora, an idea that is still uncommon in linguistics. This indicates
   that the approach can facilitate an improved understanding of diachronic

   shows (i) that psycholinguists regularly exploit the benefits of
   combining corpus and experimental data, whereas cot-pits linguists do so
   much more rarely, and (ii) that psycholinguists and corpus linguists use
   corpora in different ways in terms of the dichotomy of
   exploratory/descriptive vs. hypothesis-testing as well as the
   corpus-linguistic methods that are used. Possible reasons, for this are
   suggested and arguments are presented for why (and how) cot-pits
   linguists should look more into the possibilities of complementing their
   corpus studies with experimental data.

AB The use of corpora and corpus linguistic methods in language testing
   research is increasing at an accelerated pace. The growing body of
   language testing research that uses corpus linguistic data is a
   testament to their utility in test development and validation. Although
   there are many reasons to be optimistic about the future of using corpus
   data in language testing, the convergence of these two fields introduces
   uncharted waters that should be traversed carefully to ensure that high
   standards of methodological rigor are maintained. The objectives of this
   paper are as follows: (1) to describe and evaluate the ways corpora and
   corpus data have been used in language testing to date; and (2) to offer
   recommendations for best practices to encourage rigorous and appropriate
   corpus linguistic methods for language testing purposes. This is
   accomplished with the aid of examples from papers in this special issue,
   as well as other previous work in this area. The future holds great
   promise for a useful methodological synergy between corpus linguistics
   and language testing. The choices researchers make as they navigate the
   uncharted and challenging waters that lie ahead will ultimately
   determine whether that potential is fully realized.

AB This qualitative study presents a corpus literacy course designed and
   implemented at an undergraduate language teacher education program in
   Turkey, and its evaluation by pre-service ELT teachers. The course
   introduces the main concepts of corpus linguistics, raises future
   teachers' linguistic and pedagogical awareness through corpus
   applications, and introduces them to corpus-informed practices to
   improve their pedagogical skills. In the first phase of the study,
   students' corpus literacy levels were determined through a pre-course
   survey revealing that most of the participants did not know about
   corpora and their uses. The second and third phases were devoted to
   evaluating the course. Initially, student teachers were asked to write
   minute papers and reflection papers during the semester to evaluate the
   process. In the final phase, semi-structured interviews and focus group
   discussions were conducted after the course to explore their overall
   evaluations. Findings implied that corpus literacy integration into
   teacher education programs clearly yields positive outcomes, yet only
   one course is not enough to popularize it among EFL teachers. Hence,
   extensive exposure to corpus literacy and curriculum-wide integration in
   the TEFL programs could contribute to its popularization among future
   practitioners.

   second language acquisition research. We begin by considering the
   origins of learner corpus research, noting its roots in smaller scale
   studies of learner language. This development of learner corpus studies
   is considered in the broader context of the development of corpus
   linguistics. We then consider the aspirations that learner corpus
   researchers have had to engage with second language acquisition research
   and explore why, to date, the interaction between the two fields has
   been minimal. By exploring some of the corpus building practices of
   learner corpus research, and the theoretical goals of second language
   acquisition studies, we identify reasons for this lack of interaction
   and make proposals for how this situation could be fruitfully addressed.

   areas in linguistic studies. This paper presents an abridged historical
   review of the use of corpora from the hand-made lexicography of the 17th
   c., through biblical and grammatical studies of 18th and 19th c., to the
   first generation of electronic corpora in the 60s and later. A 'corpus'
   definition as well as its typology and main characteristics are also
   discussed. Likewise the methodological potential of CL for research in
   contemporary linguistics is also depicted, e.g. in translation critique,
   materials design for language teaching, lexical and grammatical
   differentiation of dialectal varieties, the making of descriptive
   grammars, and sociolinguistic discourse analysis.

   to be much more sophisticated, and certainly the aspects of text which
   can be studied will progress beyond plain text without images. Another

   health activists and the public. In this paper, we provide a theoretical
   framework for considering diagnostic terms as ordinary linguistic
   expressions and illustrate this approach by a corpus linguistic analysis
   of 'schizophrenia.' Our aim is to show how a focus on language itself
   can inform current and future debates about psychiatric terminology and
   provide new insights on relevant processes concerning their actual usage
   and change over time. We hope that this contributes to enhancing mutual
   understanding between different discourse spheres and stakeholders.

AB This paper argues that corpus linguistics offers a methodology which
   benefits variational pragmatic analysis in a number of ways. Corpus
   linguistic tools such as word frequency lists allow the researcher to
   construct a detailed "pragmatic profile" of a word, cluster or act.
   This, coupled with the fact that most corpora are constructed to be
   representative of a particular language variety, facilitates an accurate
   account of language-use differences across various social categories.
   Pragmatic analysis relies heavily on context for its interpretation.
   Therefore, an illustrative case study of two corpora representing spoken
   language recorded in the home environment, one from a middle class Irish
   family and one from a family from the Irish Traveller Community will be
   utilised in order to elucidate the benefits of the synergy of corpus
   linguistics and variational pragmatics. Specifically, the variational
   distribution of the occurrences of hedges across these two distinct
   cultural groupings will be examined.

AB This article investigates a topic at the intersection of translation
   studies, lexical semantics and corpus linguistics. Its general aim is to
   show how translation studies can benefit from both lexical semantics and
   corpus linguistics. The specific objective is to capture the semantic
   and pragmatic behavior of the noun destruction and its different
   translations into Arabic. The data are obtained from an English-Arabic
   parallel corpus made from UN texts and their translations (EAPCOUNT).
   The analysis of the data shows the polysemy of the word destruction as a
   number of semantic and pragmatic alternations can be captured. These
   findings are discussed in the frame of the Generative Lexicon (GL)
   theory developed by James Pustejovsky. The paper concludes with some
   concrete suggestions on how to enhance the relationship between
   linguists and translators and their mutual cooperation.

AB Scholars of language have begun to explore the popular academic topic
   that is "risk" and to establish the viability of corpus linguistics for
   such analysis. We extend existing scholarship by analyzing the noun
   lemma RISK over the last two decades of contemporary American discourse
   with recourse to the Corpus of Contemporary American English. Using the
   corpus procedures of frequency analysis, concordance contextual
   analysis, collocational analysis, and a variation on
   distinctive-collexeme analysis, we revisit the often under-supported
   assertion that RISK is semantically negative, and then investigate the
   semantic potential for good risk, a phenomenon associated with economic
   and adventuring sectors. Data suggest that RISK is genre sensitive,
   predominantly negative, and heavily medical in shared meaning across
   genres, and further, that evidence for good risk is minimal. A phrase of
   interest in recent corpus work - RISK worth taking - is shown to be
   sensitive perhaps more to constructional constraints than to semantic
   prosody.

AB CORDE (Corpus Diacronico del Espanol) and CREA (Corpus de Referencia del
   Espanol Actual) are two of the largest and most frequently used
   databases in the study of the Spanish language. However, they have some
   limitations in terms of size, sample unit and representativeness that
   may influence the results of studies and descriptions of linguistic
   phenomena. In this paper we identify these limitations and propose a
   method for the normalization of document frequencies by computing moving
   averages. We show how this method allows for a more realistic
   interpretation of corpus data and, thus, a more effective use of these
   resources.

AB Since the Web by far represents the largest public repository of natural
   language texts, recent experiments, methods, and tools in the area of
   corpus linguistics often use the Web as a corpus. For applications where
   high accuracy is crucial, the problem has to be faced that a
   non-negligible number of orthographic and grammatical errors occur in
   Web documents. In this article we investigate the distribution of
   orthographic errors of various types in Web pages. As a by-product,
   methods are developed for efficiently detecting erroneous pages and for
   marking orthographic errors in acceptable Web documents, reducing thus
   the number of errors in corpora and linguistic knowledge bases
   automatically retrieved from the Web.

AB Using a large, computerized corpus, this study aims to provide
   lexico-grammatical evidence of stereotypical constructions of age and
   aging. It focuses on elderly, a word that is pivotal to the domain in
   question and whose associative meaning is contested. The collocational
   profile drawn up on the basis of corpus evidence shows that elderly is
   primarily associated with discourses of care, disability, and
   vulnerability, emerging less as a marker of chronological age than of
   perceived social consequences. In addition to making a contribution to
   discourse-oriented aging research, the article also demonstrates the use
   of corpus linguistic methods within a sociolinguistic framework.

AB This paper concerns the development and use of a new interdisciplinary
   graphical approach in the statistical analysis of complexity of sentence
   structure for scientometric purposes. A scheme in three-dimensional
   space (barycentric plot) is used for a graphical representation of
   scientific research text correlations between the number of characters,
   the number of words, and the number of complex syllable words for
   sentences of several monolingual corpuses. The barycentric plots do not
   only drastically increase the visual information content in a given
   corpus, but at equal conditions of text-based corpus, they also
   contribute to the comparative analysis of different kinds of subject,
   section, author-style, journal, field, etc. As illustrated in present
   study, the proposed graphical approach can have broad implications and
   practical applications not only in scientometric field, but also in
   statistical linguistics, stylistic text research, and informetric
   research. This article explores the interdisciplinary approach research
   and applications of different areas of knowledge.

   creating a parallel corpus that was aligned with Deja Vu, linguistically
   tagged with TreeTagger, meta-textually tagged with Notepad++ and indexed
   with IMS Open Corpus Workbench. Furthermore, it includes a brief
   introduction to the exploration and analysis of corpora with Corpus

AB As one of the most authoritative journals in the field of quantitative
   linguistics, the Journal of Quantitative Linguistics has just passed its
   20th birthday. In this paper, we collect information from the 20 volumes
   of this journal published so far (1994-2013) to build a corpus, then
   extract different categories of information using corpus tools. By
   quantitative analysis of the corpus data, complemented with information
   extracted from abstract and citation index databases such as Scopus and
   Web of Knowledge as important references, we aim to explore the objects,
   aims and methodologies of quantitative linguistics, its focuses and
   shifts in different periods, representative achievements in the past 20
   years, and possible directions for the future. During the process, the
   role of JQL both in the development of quantitative linguistics and the
   wider scientific community are located and evaluated with
   quantitative-based evidence. The findings are that JQL contributes
   greatly to the development of quantitative linguistics and is in many
   aspects representative of changes in this field, keeping close pace with
   trends in the discipline and the ever-evolving characteristics of
   quantitative linguistics over the years.

AB Pearson's chi-squared test is probably the most popular statistical test
   used in corpus linguistics, particularly for studying linguistic
   variations between corpora. Oakes and Farrow (2007) proposed various
   adaptations of this test to allow for the simultaneous comparison of
   more than two corpora while also yielding an almost correct Type I error
   rate (i.e. claiming that a word is most frequently found in a variety of
   English, when in actuality this is not the case). By means of resampling
   procedures, the present study shows that when used in this context, the
   chi-squared test produces far too many significant results, even in its
   modified version. Several potential approaches to circumventing this
   problem are discussed in the conclusion.

AB When it goes beyond the search for attestations, corpus linguistics
   seeks to characterize texts and to describe their semantic and
   expressive forms. It must therefore finely articulate the quantitative
   and quantitative factors, using the various instruments of textometry.
   This supposes a critical perspective, which distinguishes it from the
   emergentist program of "data science", but which brings it closer to the
   other sciences of culture. They share the same comparatist program.

   agreement coefficients, covering Krippendorff's alpha as well as Scott's
   pi and Cohen's kappa; discusses the use of coefficients in several
   annotation tasks; and argues that weighted, alpha-like coefficients,
   traditionally less used than kappa-like measures in computational
   linguistics, may be more appropriate for many corpus annotation
   tasks-but that their use makes the interpretation of the value of the
   coefficient even harder.

AB Recent research has demonstrated the potential of corpus linguistics as
   a solid aid in children's understanding of how language works. However,
   the availability of data from the UK is still somewhat limited. Most
   corpora are either based on a small number of schools, synchronic in
   nature, or focused on the post-National Curriculum era (cf. Lancaster
   Corpus of Children's Project Writing, the Oxford Children's Corpus, the
   Growth in Grammar Corpus); on the other hand, historical corpora are,
   unfortunately, not publicly available in electronic format (cf. the
   Child Language Survey or the Aspects of Writing in 16+ English
   Examinations, Cambridge Assessment). This article introduces the APU
   Writing and Reading Corpus 1979-1988, a new large electronic data set of
   historical materials which are linguistically annotated. The aim is
   two-fold. First, to describe the contents of the corpus and its
   compilation procedure. Second, to illustrate its potential as a research
   and pedagogical tool by presenting a number of research case studies and
   teaching materials that are currently being developed based on the
   corpus data. All in all, the Assessment Performance Unit (APU) Corpus
   contributes to both Corpus Linguistics and Educational Linguistics by
   presenting itself as a new resource tool with replicable methodology and
   objective empirical evidence, which will be of interest to academics and
   school teachers as well as to school material developers and
   policymakers.

   in evaluating children's language developmental patterns vis-a-vis adult
   input. The transcripts in our new corpus are annotated with a
   morphological tier indicating parts of speech, and linked to audio or
   video files. This corpus goes beyond existing published corpora of child
   Mandarin in having more data for a single child, as well as media
   linking. It contributes to a number of fields including language
   acquisition, Chinese linguistics, corpus linguistics, developmental
   psycholinguistics, education, and speech and language therapy.

   empirical studies, statistical techniques, and statistical modelling
   have come to be used and determine linguistic research. Which role have
   corpus linguistics and probabilistic linguistics, including usage-based
   approaches, played in this development? Has this turn been to the
   detriment of qualitative methods, or even of linguistic theorizing in
   general? Has linguistics reached the point of a "quantitative crisis",
   or is it still a discipline characterized by a healthy equilibrium, if
   not mutual reinforcement, of quantitative and qualitative approaches?
   What are, or should be, major repercussions of the strong quantitative
   turn for the publication system of (English) linguistics? These are the
   major overarching questions underlying the reflections offered in this
   opinion paper.

AB In this article, we assume that collocations cannot be purely analysed
   with the help of a qualitative analysis, in the usual sense of
   qualitative methods in linguistics. In order to illustrate this
   intermediate position of collocations half-way between qualitative and
   quantitative criteria, we implement an empirical study with a task of
   manual identification of collocations in a corpus. This allows to
   compare the intersubjective judgment of some experts with the
   quantitative data resulting from quantitative data (frequencies,
   association measure, dispersion) in a reference corpus. The results of
   the study largely confirm our hypothesis.

   linguistics by the content analysis of AAAL annual conferences'
   handbooks. Making a diachronic research on topical strands of AAAL
   Conference from 1999 to 2019, the paper studies the dynamics and the
   trends of American applied linguistics by analyzing the changes of the
   strands in the conferences under study in 20 years. Based on self-built
   corpora of titles and abstracts of the presented papers in 2019 AAAL
   Annual Conference, high-frequency vocabulary and their collocations are
   detected by TagCrowd and AntConc in order to find the current hot topics
   of applied linguistics research. The conclusion is that the development
   of applied linguistics has speeded up in the past four years.
   Educational linguistics, corpus linguistics, research methodology,
   teacher education, lexical research, phonetics/phonology and oral
   communication are the new trends in this field. The hot words of applied
   linguistics in 2019 include academic writing, teacher education, Chinese
   and translanguaging. Finally, the study found that retrospective review
   study of international conferences could be a new research method in the
   field of review study, providing scholars with a comprehensive
   understanding of the discipline dynamics over a period of time.

AB This article addresses the development of a corpus-based grammar
   textbook on four types of irregular multi-verb sequences in English-
   V-V, V-and-V, V-to-V, and V-Ving. Since many current grammar textbooks
   have seldom treated these four types of irregular multi-verb sequences,
   this article empirically demonstrates the need to develop corpus-based
   grammar textbooks. Our framework to develop the corpus-based grammar
   textbook adopted in this article relies on two things: a combination of
   corpora and descriptions of English grammar proposed by linguists
   working in the field of theoretical linguistics. The corpus-based
   grammar textbook in this article is a pilot scheme that can be extended
   to other grammatical areas. This article thus claims that the
   development of corpus-based grammar textbooks clearly makes a positive
   contribution to grammatical instruction.

   and investigates the relation between the distribution of verbs, the
   different rhetorical moves of abstracts and the activation of conceptual
   areas. To that end, we propose a semantic classification of the most
   frequent verbs in each rhetorical section and in abstracts as a whole,
   and apply a method for the extraction of conceptual, textual and

   within the framework of corpus linguistics and the Functional-Lexematic

AB This study is a corpus-based lexical study that aims to explore the use
   of words in Coxhead's (2000) Academic Word List (AWL) in journal
   articles in the field of applied linguistics. A 1.5 million-word corpus
   called the Applied Linguistics Research Articles Corpus (ALC) was
   created for this study. The corpus consists of 200 research articles
   that have been published in five applied linguistics journals, namely,
   Applied Linguistics, Language Learning, The Modern Language Journal,
   Second Language Research, and TESOL Quarter v. Results show that AWL
   words account for 11.17% of the entire ALC. Using both frequency and
   range as the criteria for word forms selection, this study identifies
   475 AWL and 128 non-AWL word forms that are used more than 50 times in
   the ALC and at least five times across the five journals. Most of the
   AWL word forms belong to the word families included in Coxhead's first
   and second sublists. The non-AWL word forms are specialized terms in
   applied linguistics, terms related to language education and research
   methodology, and adjectives/nouns indicating countries/languages.
   Pedagogical implications are made for both teachers and learners of
   academic English as a foreign language. (C) 2008 The American

AB Contrastive Analysis and Translation Studies began to merge in the late
   1990s through the bridging role of corpus linguistics. This
   corpus-driven, contrastive-analysis approach to Translation Studies now
   faces several challenges including the inappropriate use of corpora, a
   disconnect in the logical relationship between Contrastive Analysis and
   Translation Studies, and the potential for distorted results caused by
   translational data. To overcome these difficulties, this article
   proposes an alternative approach called the corpus-tested Contrastive
   Analysis approach to Translation Studies, which draws on the typical
   empirical cycle of observation, induction, deduction, testing, and
   evaluation. The alternative approach proposed in this article requires
   both comparable corpora and translational corpora to account for key
   aspects of Contrastive Analysis and Translation Studies, and ensures the
   internal logical connection between these two areas, which can be
   attributed to the entailment law 'if p, then q'.

   a number of recent studies carried out by or with involvement of the
   author. These studies all focus on phraseological aspects of language
   and demonstrate the importance of studying its patterned nature. The
   studies also illustrate how corpora and corpus-analytic techniques can
   allow us as applied linguists to contribute to solving problems in other
   disciplines (such as legal scholarship or music theory) and hope to
   thereby encourage more interdisciplinary research collaborations between
   corpus linguists and scholars from other fields.

AB Given the importance of corpus linguistics in language learning, there
   have been calls for the integration of corpus training into teacher
   education programmes. However, the question of what knowledge and skills
   the training should target remains unclear. Hence, we advance our
   understanding of measures and outcomes of teacher corpus training by
   proposing and testing a five-component theoretical framework for
   measuring teachers' perceived corpus literacy (CL) and its subskills:
   understanding, search, analysis, and the advantages and limitations of
   corpora. Also, we hypothesised that teacher CL is linked to their
   intention to use corpora in classroom teaching. Specifically, 183
   teachers and student teachers received corpus training to develop their
   CL and then completed a survey to measure their CL and intention to use
   corpora in teaching in Likert-scale items together with open-ended
   questions. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a hierarchical
   factor structure for CL using the aforementioned five subfactors best
   fitted the data. Moreover, structural equation modelling indicated that
   CL is positively linked to the participants' intention to integrate
   corpora into classroom teaching. While all five subskills are important
   for teachers, greater effort should be made to develop their corpus
   search and analysis skills, which can be viewed as the "bread and
   butter" of corpus training.

AB This article discusses two types of opportunities for interdisciplinary
   collaboration between computational linguistics (CL) and language
   learning research. We target the connection between data and theory in
   second language (L2) research and highlight opportunities to (a) enrich
   the options for obtaining data and (b) support the identification and
   valid interpretation of relevant learner data. We first characterize
   options, limitations, and potential for obtaining rich data on learning:
   from Web-based intervention studies supporting the collection of
   experimentally controlled data to online workbooks facilitating
   large-scale, longitudinal corpus collection for a range of learning
   tasks and proficiency levels. We then turn to the question of how corpus
   data can systematically be used for L2 research, focusing on the central
   role that linguistic corpus annotation plays in that regard. We show
   that learner language poses particular challenges to human and CL
   analysis and requires more interdisciplinary discussion of analysis
   frameworks and advances in annotation schemes.

AB This primarily methodological article makes a proposition for linguistic
   exploration of textual resources available through the Google Scholar
   search engine. These resources (Google Scholar virtual corpus) are
   significantly larger than any existing corpus of academic writing.
   Google Scholar, however, was not designed for linguistic searches and
   special attention therefore needs to be paid to maximising its
   effectiveness in corpus linguistics research. The article discusses the
   search capacity of Google Scholar and compares the Google Scholar
   virtual corpus with the largest traditional corpus of written academic
   English, COCA - academic. Finally, the article offers a case study on
   the as-author-reporting verb structure (and its modifications). The
   study demonstrates that Google Scholar can be employed effectively in
   EAP research offering us new insights into reporting practices in two
   disciplines, Applied Linguistics and Physics, which were chosen for
   comparison. The benefits of using Google Scholar virtual corpus are the
   following: 1) wide representativeness of written academic language, 2)
   possibility of capturing subtle variation in academic patterns, and 3)
   possibility of comparing linguistic patterns across different academic
   fields. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Corpus linguistics and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are
   approaches exploiting computer-based methodologies in the study of,
   respectively, language and language usage, and spatial patterns in
   geographical databases. We present an approach that uses corpus methods
   to bridge the gap between the textual content of a corpus (and, thus,
   the typically textual concerns of many branches of the humanities) and
   the geo-referenced database at the heart of a GIS. Using part-of-speech
   tagging to extract instances of proper nouns from a corpus, and a
   gazetteer to limit these instances to those representing place-names, a
   database of the places mentioned in a corpus can be created, visualized,
   and analysed using GIS technology. It is also possible to visualize the
   meanings associated with particular place-names, by building GIS
   databases on the collocation of place-names with particular semantic
   categories in their immediate context. In this way, we can create maps
   that visualize the geographical distribution of mentions of concepts
   such as war, government, or money in a particular data set. The approach
   cannot be entirely automated and some manual intervention is required.
   Nevertheless, the method is clearly valuable for the interpretation of
   spatial phenomena in text corpora.

AB This paper analyzes formulaic language in conference abstracts in
   Applied Linguistics and tracks an application of the findings to a
   second language English academic writing context. Specifically, the
   authors identify and profile phrase-frames (a form of discontin-uous
   formulaic sequence) in terms of their frequency, internal variation,
   predictability, structure, and rhetorical functions in a corpus of
   approximately 1,600 conference abstracts in Applied Linguistics. The
   analysis informed a corpus-and genre-based second language writing
   pedagogical intervention on formulaic language, and the paper also
   presents the experiences of learners through sample student writing,
   survey, and interview data. Overall, findings highlight the pedagogical
   potential for including frame-based formulaic language in second
   language writing pedagogy due to the prevalence and inherent
   pro-ductivity of such features, the clear role they play in signaling
   functional intentions in rhetoric, and their ability to stimulate
   reflection and discussion of formulaicity in writing more broadly. (c)

AB This paper presents a new corpus of computer-mediated communication on
   the topic of Trump's comments about household disinfectants and
   ultraviolet light as cures for COVID-19. The corpus, named the
   Ultraviolet Bleach (UVB) corpus, contains message board comments devoted
   to Trump's suggestions. It was collected in May 2020 and consists of
   twenty-six files, with a total size of 2,344,164 word tokens. The paper
   includes frequency lists of words and clusters, keywords, and keywords
   in context, identified with the help of the corpus management software
   Sketch Engine. The corpus highlights the "receiving end" of political
   communication since it involves reactions to Trump's televised briefing,
   and it will be of interest to researchers of political communication,
   populist and conspiratorial discourse, public opinion, and language
   aggression.

AB The use of corpus material and methods represents a major methodological
   innovation in Chinese historical linguistics. The very exciting findings
   uncovered in this article may be seen as the first systematic
   large-scale investigation of the various morpho-syntactic patterns
   underpinning the evolution of Chinese lexis. In this article, we have
   made a ground-breaking investigation into the diverse lexical modes and
   patterns which have emerged and developed in each major period in
   Chinese history, in which the generation of corpus linguistic data and
   the subsequent computational statistical modelling have been essential.

AB The aim of this paper is to show that conceptualizing and defining those
   subsets of data that the researcher extracts from an online searchable
   corpus constitutes a step forward towards more methodological
   transparency, especially in those settings where researchers do not
   build their own corpora, but use those that can be searched online. To
   that end, in Section 2 a succinct typology of online searchable corpora
   for the study of language-pair related or translation-related phenomena
   will be drawn. In Section 3, the concept of secondary sample corpus will
   be put forward, which, in turn, will shed new light on the status of
   web-based parallel (and parallelized) corpora. Section 4 will be devoted
   to general methodological requirements and to requirements of the
   quantitative approach as the main - but not the only - approach shaping
   the research work in the fields of Corpus-based Descriptive Translation
   Studies and Corpus-based Contrastive Linguistics; the focus will lie on
   issues of replicability, comparability, availability and usability. In
   Section 5, some brief conclusions will be drawn.

AB This article uses corpus linguistic methodologies to explore
   representations of lesbian desires and identities in a corpus of lesbian
   erotica from the 1980s and 1990s. We provide a critical examination of
   the ways in which "lesbian gender," power, and desire are represented,
   (re-)produced, and enacted, often in ways that challenge hegemonic
   discourses of gender and sexuality. By examining word frequencies and
   collocations, we critically analyze some of the themes, processes, and
   patterns of representation in the texts. Although rooted in linguistics,
   we hope this article provides an accessible, interdisciplinary, and
   timely contribution toward developing understandings of discursive
   practices surrounding gender and sexuality.
